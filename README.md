This is my task as intern in Prodigy infotech.
TASK1: Creating a python program that can perform encryption and decryption using caesar algorithm which allows user to input desired messages and contains a shift value to perform encryption and decryption 

CEASAR CIPHER

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Encryption Process:

Choose a shift value, often denoted as 
k.
Shift each letter in the plaintext by 
ùëò
k positions in the alphabet.
Wrap around the alphabet if necessary (e.g., shifting 'z' by 1 results in 'a').
Non-alphabet characters (like spaces or punctuation) remain unchanged.

Decryption Process:

To decrypt, use the reverse shift (i.e., shift by 
26
‚àí
ùëò
26‚àík, where 26 is the number of letters in the English alphabet).

SECURITY

The Caesar cipher is easily breakable by modern cryptographic standards because there are only 25 possible shifts. Therefore, it provides very little security against modern techniques.

APPLICATIONS

1. follows the syntax OF programming script
2. Enables to make a choice whether to encrypt or decrypt
